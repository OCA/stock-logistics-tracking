This module modifies the behavior of the buttons *Put in new
pack* on operations (button provided by the module
*stock_packing_usability*) and *Put in pack* on pickings (native button):
when you click on those buttons, Odoo will ask you to select the
packaging (object *product.packaging*) of the package.
