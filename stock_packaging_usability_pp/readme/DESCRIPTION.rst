This module allows to select the packaging (e.g. EUR-pallet, box 50x40x30, package 30x20x17, ...) on the fly when you define a new pack on a picking. It modifies the behavior of the buttons **Put in new pack** on operations (button provided by the module *stock_packing_usability*) and **Put in pack** on pickings (native button): when you click on those buttons, Odoo will ask you to select the packaging (object *product.packaging*) of the package.
