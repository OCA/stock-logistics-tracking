Stock Packaging Usability
=========================

Usage
=====

This module adds 2 buttons in the *Transfer* wizard of the picking:

* *Put in current pack* (this button is native in v7 but not in v8)

* *Put residual in new pack* : all the lines that are not in a package
    will be put in a new package.

So this module is a time saver when you use the packaging features of Odoo !
For example, on a picking where all the products go in the same package, you
just have to click on the button *Put residual in new pack* and you're done:
no need to click on each line !
