This module makes it faster to define which product goes in which pack on an outgoing picking. It adds 2 buttons in the *Operations* lines of a picking:

* **Put in current pack**

* **Put in new pack**

It is a complement of the button **Put in Pack** which is available on the picking. With these 2 new buttons, you are not obliged to set the *Done quantity* package by package.
